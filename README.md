# Multi-Class-Classifier
Created text classifier and applied it to two datasets corresponding to two tasks: (1) spam filtering, and (2) sentiment analysis.
One file with source code to learn the model (nblearn.py) and one file with source code to classify new text (nbclassify.py).
Training file could look like this:

HAM subject : meeting today hi , could we have a meeting today . thank you . 
SPAM subject : low rates click here to apply for new low rates do not miss this chance !

To learn a classification model from the training data file,software will be invoked in the following way:

python3 nblearn.py TRAININGFILE MODELFILE

where TRAININGFILE is the name of the training file (this should be spam_training.txt for the spam dataset, and sentiment_training.txt for the sentiment dataset), MODELFILE is the name of the file that will contain the model that the classifier will learn (for the spam dataset the file name should be spam.nb, and sentiment.nb for the sentiment dataset).
To classify a file with new documents, software will be invoked in the following way:

python3 nbclassify.py MODELFILE TESTFILE

where MODELFILE is the name of the model file generated by nblearn, TESTFILE is the name of the file containing the features for the new documents to be classified.
